# State: Coward's Game

**Initialized:** 2026-05-16
**Status:** Phase 51 context gathered and ready to plan

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-22)

**Core value:** Players can design, run, replay, and understand deterministic autonomous doctrines competing under the canonical Coward's Game rules.
**Current focus:** Phase 51 - Service Contract Generation and Route Migration
**Latest shipped milestone:** v1.7 Runtime and Backend Boundary Stabilization
**Requirements:** v1.8 requirements mapped 38/38 in .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
**Roadmap:** .planning/ROADMAP.md

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.8 hardens operating boundaries without moving orchestration, backend writes, jobs, migrations, or Strategy execution out of the TypeScript-owned path.
- Go remains read-only and parity-focused against real fixtures or safe local data.
- Sandbox work is evaluative only; no candidate is promoted to production hostile-code isolation or counted-play eligibility by default.
- Non-JS Strategy support remains experimental and fail-closed for counted MatchSets, ladders, and gauntlets.
- Public replay, service, Go, topology, diagnostics, analytics, exports, and monitor outputs must omit private Strategy/runtime data by default.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backend | Go mutation endpoints, orchestration, persistence writes, job claiming, migrations, and Match execution | Deferred | v1.8 requirements |
| runtime | Production hostile-code sandbox promotion | Deferred | v1.8 requirements |
| runtime | Counted non-JS MatchSets, ladders, or gauntlets by default | Deferred | v1.8 requirements |
| product | Public language picker implying support parity | Deferred | v1.8 requirements |
| ops | Kubernetes, service mesh, cloud deployment, or production observability stack | Deferred | v1.8 requirements |
