- v1.23 milestone and artifact baselines
- Runtime packages and boundary monitor scripts touched by v1.24

## Findings

- v1.23 is the baseline and remains archived; v1.24 evidence reuses it without promoting Rust, Zig, Python, or WASM/WASI to counted play.
- The active execution ABI remains WASI Preview 1 stdin/stdout JSON. Direct exports and Component Model/WIT are evidence spikes only.
- Public-safe evidence must avoid private runtime data and should distinguish local policy contracts from live proof.
- The readiness matrix covers JS/TS, Python, Rust, Zig, WASM/WASI, direct exports, and Component Model/WIT with honest stronger-claim gaps and no certification.

## Uncertainties Resolved

- Production sandbox certification is not claimed.
- JS/TS remains the counted Strategy path.
- Python, Rust, and Zig remain non-counted exhibition beta.
- Go/runtime-service ownership stays unchanged.
