# Milestones

## v1.0 MVP

**Status:** Shipped 2026-05-17
**Phases:** 7
**Plans:** 33
**Requirements:** 80/80 satisfied
**Audit:** .planning/milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md

### Delivered

- Established a strict TypeScript monorepo with canonical spec contracts, package boundaries, local topology, and selected E2E verification in pnpm verify.
- Implemented the deterministic Coward's Game rules engine, covering rounds, activation selection, movement, pushing, Backstab, stoning, contraction, end conditions, and purity tests.
- Built Chronicle and replay infrastructure for deterministic reconstruction, integrity validation, public privacy projection, and owner-only debug data.
- Delivered a replaceable JS/TS strategy runtime boundary with immutable Strategy Revisions, validation, worker-only execution, timeout/failure handling, and no production node:vm execution.
- Added PostgreSQL-backed Match/MatchSet orchestration, job claiming, retries, Chronicle persistence, deterministic scoring, and worker execution.
- Shipped the Strategy Workshop and replay viewer, including Monaco authoring, revision history, Workshop test launch, Pixi replay board, timeline/inspector, owner Awareness Grid, and service-backed edit-to-replay Playwright coverage.

## v1.1 Trustworthy Simulation Beta

**Status:** Shipped 2026-05-18
**Phases:** 6
**Plans:** 29
**Requirements:** 34/34 satisfied
**Audit:** .planning/milestones/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md

### Delivered

- Replaced fragile replay demos with engine-generated legal scenario fixtures and focused replay visual regression coverage.
- Added strict Chronicle grammar, compatibility, snapshot boundary, impossible-state, and public privacy validation gates.
- Hardened the Strategy runtime boundary with adapter metadata, subprocess JSON IPC, hostile Strategy coverage, output caps, and system-vs-strategy failure taxonomy.
- Improved doctrine debugging with actionable Workshop messages, sample Strategies, replay links, runtime violation explanations, and owner-only Soldier inactivity explanations.
- Made Docker/no-Docker local startup and service-backed CI verification repeatable with layered diagnostics.
- Closed the persisted owner replay debug authorization gap and proved public privacy on the same failing Strategy replay.
